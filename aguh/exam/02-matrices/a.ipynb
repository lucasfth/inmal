    "## 1. Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "A matrix is a rectangular of size $m \\times n$ for $m$ rows and $n$ columns. In machine learning, we can combine multiple vectors representing data points to create a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Matrix operations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Addition\n",
    "\n",
    "For two matrices of equal size, we can add or subtract each component such that we get a resulting matrix of same size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalar Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "We can multiply a matrix with a single scalar such that we multiply each component of the matrix with the scalar value, essentially scaling the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix Multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also multiply two matrices with each-other by the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$c_{ij} = \\sum_{k=1}^n a_{ik} * b_{kj}$\n",
    "\n",
    "for matrices A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given two matrices $n \\times m$ and $m \\times k$, such that the first matrix' number of columns equals the second matrix' number of rows, we can calculate each cell $c_{ij}$ in the resulting $n \\times k$ matrix as:  \n",
    "Start on the left-most cell of the $i$th row in $A$ and the top-most cell of the $j$th column in $B$ and multiply these values. Then multiply these two values and go one to the right and one down in respectively $A$ then $B$ and multiply these values. Repeat for a total of $m$ repetitions and sum all these multiplication results together to get the value for $c_{ij}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix multiplication can be used to solve sets of linear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that matrix multiplication is non-commutative meaning $AB \\neq BA$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transpose\n",
    "\n",
    "We write $A^T$ to denote a transposed matrix, meaning it is flipped over its diagonal axis (axis from top left to bottom right). This is used to calculate covariance matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\begin{matrix}\n",
    "    a & b \\\\\n",
    "    c & d \\\\\n",

    "$\\begin{matrix}\n",
    "    a & c \\\\\n",
    "    b & d \\\\\n",
    "\\end{matrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determinant\n",
    "\n",
    "The scalar value for the determinant of a square matrix is denoted $det(A)$ and is used to figure out if a matrix can be inverted (see following section). If the determinant is 0, no solution exists and the matrix is called singular.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inverse\n",
    "\n",
    "The inverse of a matrix is written $A^{-1}$ and is defined as a matrix that makes $AA^{-1}=I$ true for the identity matrix $I$. The identity matrix is the square matrix (size $n \\times n$) such that for component $c_{ij}$ where $i=j$, the component is $1$ and the remaining are $0$. There only exists an inverse matrix for square matrices with a non-zero determinant. The inverse is used to solving systems of linear equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a $2 \\times 2$ matrix\n",
    "$A = [\\begin{matrix}\n",
    "    a & b \\\\\n",
    "    c & d \\\\\n",
    "\\end{matrix}]$\n",
    "\n",
    "the inverse matrix can be found as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "A^{-1}=\\frac{1}{ad-bc}\n",
    "[\\begin{matrix}\n",
    "    d & -b \\\\\n",
    "    -c & a \\\\\n",
    "\\end{matrix}]$\n",
    "\n",
    "Two rules for inverses:\n",
    "\n",
    "$(ABC)^{-1} = C^{-1}B^{-1}A^{-1}$  \n",
    "$(A^T)^{-1} = (A^{-1})^T$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Orthogonality\n",
    "\n",
    "Two matrices are orthogonal if its transpose equals its inverse: $A^T = A^{-1}$. If it is multiplied by its tranposed self it will equal the identity matrix. It is used to rotate matrices.\n",
