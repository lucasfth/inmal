    "## Linear equations\n",
    "\n",
    "A set of $n$ linear equations with $n$ unknowns can be solved by combining matrix multiplication, matrix determinants and inverse matrices.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can write a set of linear equations as $Ax = b$ where $A$ is the coefficient matrix, $x = n \\times 1$ vector of variables and $b = n \\times 1$ vector of constants for a matrix $A$ of size $n \\times n$ (square).\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, for each equation create a row in $A$ such that $a_1x_1 + ... + a_nx_n + b$ for variables $x_1, ..., x_n$ and constant $b$ is rewritten to the row in $A$ as $[a_1, ..., a_n]$. Each column should of course be aligned so it represents the same variable $x_i$. The 1-column vector $b$ then consists of the constants from each linear equation in the same row as the coefficients are in $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then rewrite $Ax=b$ to $AA^{-1}x=bA^{-1} => x=bA^{-1}$ for invertible matrices $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we find the inverse matrix $A^{-1}$ and use matrix multiplication with the constants $b$ we get the values in a 1-column vector for $x$ such that the first row in $x$ corresponds to $x_1$ and the last row corresponds to $x_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$3x_1 + 4x_2 = 35$  \n",
    "$4x_1 + 2x_2 = 20$  \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for linear equations we can rewrite them to the form $a_1x_1 + ... + a_n+x_n = b$ - if not, the equation is not linear (e.g. it contains $x_i * x_j$ for two input variables $x_i,x_j \\in \\{x_1 ... x_n\\}$). Note that the above linear equations might as well have used $x$ and $y$ as input variables than $x_1$ and $x_2$, but for simplicity we do the latter.\n",
