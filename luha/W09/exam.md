## Outline for Presentation on Classification and Decision Boundaries

1. Introduction (30 seconds)
    * Introduce the topic of classification and decision boundaries in machine learning.
    * Highlight the focus areas:
        * (a) Linear classification, kernels, and classification boundaries.
        * (b) Logistic regression and its classification boundaries.
        * (c) Linear and non-linear decision boundaries, including SVMs.
2. Linear Classification, Kernels, and Boundaries (1.5 minutes)
    * Linear Classification:
        * Define linear classifiers and their decision boundaries (e.g., perceptrons, linear regression for classification).
    * Kernels:
        * Explain how kernels extend linear classifiers to higher dimensions by mapping data to feature spaces.
        * Relate to practical applications in 01-decision.ipynb.
    * Classification Boundaries:
        * Show examples of linear decision boundaries and discuss their limitations in handling non-linearly separable data.
3. Logistic Regression and Decision Boundaries (1.5 minutes)
    * Logistic Regression:
        * Introduce logistic regression as a probabilistic model for binary classification.
        * Highlight its ability to output probabilities and model non-linear decision boundaries using feature transformations.
    * Decision Boundaries:
        * Explain how sigmoid functions generate smooth, probabilistic boundaries.
        * Use examples from 02-logistic_regression.ipynb to demonstrate fitting and interpreting logistic regression boundaries.
4. Linear and Non-Linear Decision Boundaries with SVMs (1.5 minutes)
    * Support Vector Machines (SVMs):
        * Introduce SVMs as a powerful method for classification with linear and non-linear kernels (e.g., radial basis functions).
    * Linear Decision Boundaries:
        * Discuss how SVMs identify the optimal hyperplane for linearly separable data.
    * Non-Linear Decision Boundaries:
        * Explain the use of kernels (e.g., polynomial, Gaussian) to handle complex classification problems.
        * Highlight practical examples from Week 10 content or 01-decision.ipynb.
    * Comparison with Logistic Regression:
        * Briefly contrast SVMs and logistic regression regarding decision boundary flexibility and applications.
5. Practical Demonstrations (1 minute)
    * 01-decision.ipynb:
        * Show linear classification boundaries and explore kernel transformations.
    * 02-logistic_regression.ipynb:
        * Demonstrate logistic regression with probabilistic decision boundaries.
    * 03-hog.ipynb:
        * Connect classification concepts to feature extraction (e.g., HOG) and its role in enhancing classification performance.
6. Conclusion (30 seconds)
    * Recap key takeaways:
        * Linear classifiers and kernels are foundational for classification.
        * Logistic regression provides probabilistic boundaries for simple and transformed features.
        * SVMs extend these concepts to handle complex data using flexible, non-linear boundaries.
    * Emphasize the importance of decision boundaries in model accuracy and generalization.
