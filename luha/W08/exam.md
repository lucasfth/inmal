## Outline for Presentation on Filtering in ML

1. Introduction (30 seconds)
    * Briefly introduce the concept of filtering in data processing and its relevance in ML.
    * Highlight the focus areas:
        * (a) Filtering: Convolution, correlation, blurring/smoothing, and noise reduction.
        * (b) Filtering: Derivatives, gradients, and edge detection.
2. Filtering: Convolution, Correlation, and Smoothing (1.5 minutes)
    * Convolution and Correlation:
        * Define and differentiate convolution and correlation in signal and image processing.
        * Discuss their role in feature extraction and smoothing.
        * Highlight examples from 02-filter_basics.ipynb to show how convolution filters are applied to data.
    * Blurring/Smoothing:
        * Explain how blurring reduces noise and enhances features.
        * Show examples of Gaussian or mean filters applied to noisy data.
    * Noise Reduction:
        * Discuss filtering techniques for removing noise while preserving data integrity.
3. Filtering: Derivatives, Gradients, and Edges (1.5 minutes)
    * Derivatives and Gradients:
        * Define derivatives in the context of filtering and their role in detecting changes in data (e.g., intensity gradients in images).
        * Explain how gradient-based filters (e.g., Sobel filter) detect edges and transitions.
    * Edge Detection:
        * Discuss edge-detection algorithms and their relevance in feature extraction for ML models.
        * Show practical examples from 02-filter_basics.ipynb where edge-detection filters are applied.
    * Applications:
        * Highlight applications in image classification, object detection, and preprocessing for ML models.
4. Practical Demonstrations (1 minute)
    * 01-data_cleaning.ipynb:
        * Demonstrate how filtering techniques are used to preprocess and clean data.
    * 02-filter_basics.ipynb:
        * Showcase examples of applying convolution, smoothing, and edge detection to enhance data features.
5. Conclusion (30 seconds)
    * Summarize the importance of filtering in data preprocessing and feature extraction.
    * Emphasize the dual focus:
        * Smoothing techniques reduce noise and prepare data for analysis.
        * Derivative-based filters highlight features like edges and gradients critical for ML tasks.
