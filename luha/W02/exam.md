# Exam

## Outline for Presentation on Week 2 Exercises (Vectors)

1. Introduction (30 seconds)
    * Briefly introduce the topic of vectors in ML.
    * Highlight the focus: inner products, vector operations, and distance metrics.
    * Mention how these concepts relate to ML tasks, particularly evaluation metrics.
2. Key Concepts and Definitions (1 minute)
    * Inner Products: Explain their role in ML (e.g., similarity measures, projections in feature spaces).
    * Vector Operations: Summarize basic operations (addition, scaling) with examples.
    * Distance Metrics: Discuss key metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan) and their relevance to ML models like k-NN and clustering.
3. Practical Demonstrations (2 minutes)
    * Walk through a key example from each notebook:
        * Poses.ipynb (01 and 02): Show how vector operations or inner products are applied in the given exercises. Highlight key observations.
        * Practical Introduction.ipynb: Focus on how distance metrics are calculated and interpreted in the practical tasks.
    * Relate these calculations to ML tasks (e.g., evaluating predictions or feature space transformations).
4. Relation to Week 10 (30 seconds)
    * Mention briefly how these vector-based metrics connect to evaluation methods discussed in Week 10 (e.g., cosine similarity, precision-recall evaluation).
5. Conclusion (1 minute)
    * Summarize the importance of understanding vectors and metrics for ML tasks.
    * Emphasize practical takeaways: how these operations enable effective feature representation and evaluation.
