## Outline for Presentation on Linear Least Squares and Affine Functions

1. Introduction (30 seconds)
    * Introduce the topic of linear least squares and its significance in model fitting and optimization.
    * Highlight the focus areas:
        * (a) Relation between linear least squares and projections.
        * (b) Application to model fitting (design matrix, kernel, lines, polynomials, affine, and multivariate functions).
        * (c) Learning affine functions and linear optimization.
2. Linear Least Squares and Projections (1 minute)
    * Function Minimization:
        * Explain the core idea of linear least squares: minimizing the sum of squared residuals.
    * Relation to Projections:
        * Describe how least squares can be interpreted as projecting data onto a subspace.
        * Use a simple geometric example to show how the best-fit line minimizes orthogonal distances.
3. Model Fitting with Linear Least Squares (2 minutes)
    * Design Matrix and Kernel:
        * Explain the role of the design matrix in encoding input data for fitting models.
        * Discuss the kernel as a feature transformation method.
    * Model Examples:
        * Lines and Polynomials: Highlight examples from 01-tutorial-qa.ipynb, showing how least squares is used for line fitting and higher-order polynomials.
        * Affine and Multivariate Functions:
            * Explain how least squares is extended to fit affine transformations and multivariate models.
            * Use examples to demonstrate interpreting results (e.g., coefficients and residuals).
    * Connection to Week 7:
        * Relate these methods to broader ML contexts, such as overfitting and regularization in polynomial models.
4. Learning Affine Functions and Linear Optimization (1.5 minutes)
    * Affine Functions:
        * Define affine functions and their significance in ML (e.g., transformations, feature mapping).
    * Learning Process:
        * Demonstrate examples from 02-affine_spatial_regression.ipynb, showing how parameters of affine functions are optimized using least squares.
    * Linear Optimization:
        * Briefly discuss how linear optimization techniques are used in minimizing cost functions for affine models.
        * Highlight practical implications (e.g., applications in spatial regression).
5. Conclusion (30 seconds)
    * Summarize key takeaways:
        * Linear least squares provides a foundation for projections and model fitting.
        * Affine functions and multivariate extensions are powerful tools in ML for representing complex relationships.
        * Understanding these concepts bridges the gap between basic regression and advanced optimization techniques.
