## Outline for Presentation on Linear and Non-Linear Transformations

1. Introduction (30 seconds)
    * Briefly introduce the topic of linear and non-linear transformations in ML.
    * Outline the three focus areas:
        * (a) Linear transformations in 2D/3D and their extensions.
        * (b) Learning linear and non-linear models using matrix inverses.
        * (c) Affine transformations, homogeneous coordinates, and composition of transformations.
2. Exploring Linear Transformations (1.5 minutes)
    * 2D and 3D Transformations:
        * Explain key operations (scaling, shearing, reflections, rotations, translations).
        * Highlight visual and mathematical representations using matrices.
    * Extensions to Higher Dimensions:
        * Briefly discuss the generalization to n-dimensional spaces.
    * Linear vs. Non-Linear Transformations:
        * Describe affine transformations as a bridge between linear and non-linear transformations.
        * Use examples to illustrate how adding translations or other offsets transforms a linear operation into an affine one.
3. Learning Models with Matrix Inverses (1.5 minutes)
    * Linear Models:
        * Show how models (e.g., simple regression) can be trained using matrix inverses (e.g., least squares solution).
        * Demonstrate with examples from 01-polynomials.ipynb.
    * Non-Linear Models:
        * Explain how higher-degree polynomial models can also use matrix inverses for parameter estimation.
    * Model Complexity and Data Requirements:
        * Discuss the tradeoff between polynomial degree and data size:
            * Higher-degree models require more data to avoid overfitting.
            * Use visual or numerical examples to reinforce the concept.
4. Affine Transformations and Homogeneous Coordinates (1.5 minutes)
    * Affine Transformations:
        * Explain their role in enabling translations, scaling, and rotations in a unified framework.
    * Homogeneous Coordinates:
        * Describe how they allow translations to be represented in matrix form.
        * Give an example of combining transformations (e.g., rotation + translation).
    * Composition of Transformations:
        * Discuss how multiple linear transformations can be composed efficiently using matrix multiplication.
        * Use 02-penpaper.ipynb to show a worked example.
5. Conclusion (30 seconds)
    * Summarize the relationships:
        * Linear transformations enable core operations in ML and geometry.
        * Affine transformations and homogeneous coordinates provide a bridge to non-linear systems.
    * Emphasize the importance of understanding these transformations for applications like image processing, PCA, and regression.
