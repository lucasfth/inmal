# Exam

## Outline for Presentation on Mandatory Assignment 1

1. Introduction (30 seconds)
    * Provide an overview of the assignment, focusing on:
        * (a) Preprocessing and feature extraction.
        * (b) Model predictions and learning.
        * (c) Model evaluation.
    * Highlight the practical application of these steps in building robust ML pipelines.
2. Preprocessing and Feature Extraction (1.5 minutes)
    * Data Cleaning and Preparation:
        * Summarize key preprocessing steps from 01-data-preprocessing.ipynb, such as handling missing values, normalizing features, or encoding categorical data.
    * Feature Extraction:
        * Explain how relevant features were selected or engineered from raw data.
        * Highlight examples where feature extraction improved model input quality (e.g., gaze-related features from raw data).
    * Importance of Preprocessing:
        * Emphasize how preprocessing impacts downstream model performance.
3. Model Predictions and Learning (1.5 minutes)
    * Model Training:
        * Walk through the models used (e.g., linear regression, decision trees) as demonstrated in 02-gaze.ipynb.
        * Explain the training process and any hyperparameter choices.
    * Predictions:
        * Discuss how the models generate predictions from preprocessed and extracted features.
    * Learning Process:
        * Highlight how models learn patterns from training data and adapt to new observations.
        * Relate the learning process to the complexity of the features extracted.
4. Model Evaluation (1.5 minutes)
    * Evaluation Metrics:
        * Discuss metrics used for evaluation (e.g., accuracy, RMSE, precision/recall).
    * Comparison of Models:
        * Highlight how different models performed based on the evaluation metrics.
    * Insights and Improvements:
        * Explain any observations on model behavior, such as overfitting or underfitting.
        * Suggest potential improvements (e.g., better preprocessing or additional features).
5. Conclusion (30 seconds)
    * Recap the workflow:
        * Preprocessing and feature extraction are critical for model success.
        * Predictions and learning demonstrate how models adapt to data.
        * Evaluation metrics provide insights into model performance and areas for refinement.
    * Highlight how these steps create a cohesive ML pipeline.
